I don't know what this will be. I don't know if this will be anything. I don't know much... 
This all started about a year ago during a bout of insommnia, when I got it into my head that 
"hey, I should have a website. I like websites...I mean, I use websites...I'm gonna buy a website".

So I bought a website.

I bought my last name [www.caracappa.us](www.caracappa.us) 

I would have liked to by "www.caracappa.com" but it was taken. I can only imagine that
somewhere out there, perhaps one of the dozens of humans out of 7 billion
with the last name "Caracappa", had both the knowhow and the same exact thought. 

So, "www.caracappa.us".

I like the ".us" ending, ".com" is so pretentious - like IBM and Hillary Clinton have ".com" addresses, who do I think I am?

Anyway, [www.caracappa.us](www.caracappa.us) sat dormant for about a year. I'd think about it every now an then, typing in the URL
in a near by computer just to see the same landing page provided by the hosting site. It was like a sad plant I didn't really want, the 
result of an impulse buy, hardly watered - looking for attention.

This brings me to today.

I repeated the ritual of typing in that long neglected URL into my address bar and repeated the sad tradition of staring at that same 
landing page. I wanted to do something for that near-forgotten URL, I HAD to... it's just sitting there...waiting for some purpose in
life. I can relate to that. But what could I do? I could "host" it somewhere! Yeah...I have a vague idea of what that means. 
So I googled - google.com, great site if you haven't heard of it - and found out that [github](www.github.com) lets you host a site for
free. 

Github? Oh, it's a place where people who took useful majors in college - engineering, computer science, etc. - can put their 
code for others to see and use. There's more to it than that but you either know that or don't care, plus as someone who
didn't take a useful major in college - sorry professors, see you at the next mixer - you wouldn't want me to describe it in further
detail.

Github likes you to name your creations, or "repositories", even suggests a name so you don't leave it blank. It suggested a name to me...

"Ubiquitous Happiness"

"Wow", I thought..."what a concept, I could use some of that".

So here I am, using some kind of text editor and some program called "Jekyll" - which the internet assures me is a very cool thing
that lets you make blogs on your Github site. Something that I am doing right now! Kismet really.

I don't know what this will be. I don't know if this will be anything. I don't know much... 
Wanna take a ride?
